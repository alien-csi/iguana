# Introduction

Green iguana


Please separate paragraphs with a double line.

## Aims

* To gather species interaction data for the green iguana *Iguana iguana*.
from the Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) database and from the literature.
* To visualize the interactions as into a network. 
* To update the network specifically for the Cayman Islands.
* To upload the interactions found in the literature as a dataset to GloBI and Zenodo.


## Methods
The [InteracterIAS]( {https://github.com/AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/interactias}) script was used to extract primary and secondary species interactions with *Iguana iguana* from GloBI (hereafter called the [GloBI dataset]{(https://github.com/alien-csi/alien-csi-hackathon/blob/main/Iguana/Iguanaiguana_GloBIExtract_20220307.txt)}). This dataset at this stage is not filtered for Cayman Islands species only but includes all the interactions for green iguana in the database. This dataset was then organized into a nodes file i.e. a file with all the interacting species and their attributes such as the species’ kingdom, and an edges file containing the source species, target species and type of interaction. These files were imported into the Gephi software version 0.9.2 (Bastian et al., 2009) to visualize the network. 
About 40 publications including Brunt & Davies (1994) ‘The Cayman Islands: Natural History and Biogeography’ and other publications on species occurring on the Cayman Islands  such as green and blue iguanas were used for extracting additional interactions. The list of interactions were added to the nodes and edges files to be imported into Gephi for analysis and visualization. The interaction data and metadata were also added to the [template]({https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/template-dataset}) in the [GloBI GitHub repository]{(https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions}) for validation and automatic upload to GloBI and, the dataset was published on Zenodo.  

## Results
In the GloBI database direct interactions of green iguana largely consisted of interactions in which other species are known to prey or parasitise on green iguana with a total of 66 direct interactions (Table 1). We only found five records of species eaten by green iguana, all of them plants (Fig. 2), with only one of those occurring on the Cayman Islands according to the GBIF species checklist (GBIF.org 2022).
The literature search added a total of 270 interactions or 244 unique interactions from the literature to GloBI with the majority being interactions of Iguana iguana and Cyclura lewisi. This dataset was published on Zenodo (Vlad, Peyton & Meeus 2022). Figure 3 shows the network with primary and secondary interactions extracted from GloBI with the 244 new interactions added. We found 134 additional species interactions of green iguanas on top of the 66 already incorporated into GloBI (Table 1). Fifty-seven of those are plant species eaten by green iguanas. We were able to add 106 plants present in the blue iguana’s diet at once from Burton (2011) to GloBI. Figure 4 shows only the direct interactions of iguanas. At first sight, it looks like blue and green iguana diets are quite distinct with only five plant species in common (green nodes in between the Iguana iguana and Cyclura lewisi cluster in Fig. 4). However, they do eat plants from the same genus (e.g. Annona, Capparis, Carica, Cordia, Ficus, Guapira, Haematoxylum, Hamelia, Hibiscus, Malpighia, Randia). At present, the network does not yet reflect the Cayman situation as it still includes species that do not occur on the Cayman Island such as Iguana delicatissima, Cyclura pinguis and Cyclura cornuta.

| Source/Target | Interaction type| Number of interactions pre-hackathon | Number of interactions added during the hackathon |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Source | eats | 5 | 68 |
| Source | has habitat | 0 | 2 |
| Source | hybridises with | 0 | 2 |
| Target | eats | 8 | 14 |
| Target | has host | 16 | 0 |

| Target | preys on | 15 | 37 |
| Target | pathogen of | 12 | 0 |

| Target | interacts with | 0 | 3 |



## Issues

One issue encountered had to do with the absence of the interaction type *hybridizes with* in the [OBO Relations Ontology]{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ro}. The lack of a suitable term made incorporation into GloBI impossible. This issue was circumvented by using the [*interacts with*]{http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002434} term.

# Discussion and/or Conclusion

During the hackathon we explored the species interactions of mainly green iguana and blue iguana already present in the Global Biotic Interactions database (GloBI) and added more species interactions that we extracted from the literature to GloBI. Mobilizing these data by adding them to GloBI is a crucial step in our workflow; by combining the data that we collected with the already existing data in GloBI we can construct a network containing both primary and secondary species interactions allowing us to study not only the direct but also the indirect and perhaps less obvious impacts of the green iguana invasion on the Cayman Islands. 


# Future work

We will run the [InteracterIAS] {https://github.com/AgentschapPlantentuinMeise/interactias} script again to acquire the primary and secondary interactions of green iguana from the a local instance of GloBI that is updated with the new iguana interactions from the hackathon.
To subset the species interaction network for species known to occur on the Cayman Islands we will match the species checklist from the Cayman Islands obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org 2022) with the nodes list extracted from GloBI. By doing so, the network will become more useful for the specific context of the invasion of green iguanas on the Cayman Islands.




For citations of references, we prefer the use of parenthesis, last name and year. If you use a citation manager, Elsevier – Harvard or American Psychological Association (APA) will work. If you are referencing web pages, software or so, please do so in the same way. Whenever possible, add authors and year. We have included a couple of citations along this document for you to get the idea. Please remember to always add DOI whenever available, if not possible, please provide alternative URLs. You will end up with an alphabetical order list by authors’ last name.

# Jupyter notebooks, GitHub repositories and data repositories

* Please add a list here
* Make sure you let us know which of these correspond to Jupyter notebooks. Although not supported yet, we plan to add features for them
* And remember, software and data need a license for them to be used by others, no license means no clear rules so nobody could legally use a non-licensed research object, whatever that object is
