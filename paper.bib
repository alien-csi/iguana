 abstract = {The main food items of Corallus enydris from the island of Carriacou, West Indies, were significantly different from those of mainland snakes of this species. Sixty-two per cent of the island specimens contained ectothermic prey while 14 per cent contained endothermic prey. The frequency of occurrence of ectotherms and endotherms in the mainland sample was 0 per cent and 67 per cent respectively. Corallus enydris is an opportunistic feeder and will commonly prey on ectotherms in spite of the specializations it possesses for the detection and procurement of endothermic prey.},
